Build a web application using either the Flask micro framework (for Python) or Express (for JavaScript). The webapp should provide, at the / address, a form in which you enter your name and your birthdate, and upon hitting submit, you post to /hello, where you will be given a page that greets you and tells you your age. Demonstrate in the comments section of your source code how you prevent XSS attacks and how you prevent CSRF.
